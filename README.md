Unsupervised Autoencoder Project
This repository contains an implementation of an unsupervised autoencoder built using deep learning techniques to learn compact representations of data. Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to compress and reconstruct input data, making them useful for tasks such as anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, and denoising.

Project Overview
Goal: Train an unsupervised autoencoder to learn latent representations of input data.

Approach: Use an encoder-decoder architecture that minimizes reconstruction loss.

Use Case(s):

Dimensionality reduction

Anomaly detection
